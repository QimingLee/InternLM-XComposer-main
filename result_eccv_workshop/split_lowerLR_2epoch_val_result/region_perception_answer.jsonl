It appears to be parked on the side of the road near a building with a blue sign that reads \"ZH\". The presence of this vehicle may influence the driving behavior of the ego car by necessitating increased caution and possibly requiring the driver to adjust their lane position or speed to safely navigate around it without causing any accidents or disruptions in traffic flow."}
