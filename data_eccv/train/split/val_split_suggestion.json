Traffic cones indicate that the driver should be alert to potential obstacles or road construction ahead. Obstacles on the right suggest that overtaking may be unsafe or not possible, hence maintaining lane discipline is important. In the absence of visible traffic signs or signals, the driver should adhere to the basic traffic rules for such roads and remain vigilant for any unforeseen situations or changes in the traffic environment. Additionally, the vehicle should be prepared to respond to the traffic lights at intersections."

It should then wait until the truck finishes its task and moves out of the way or, if possible, carefully reverse to find a different route to continue. The ego car should also keep watch for any unexpected movements from the parked vehicles nearby. Maintaining a cautious approach speed and readiness to stop is advisable due to the potential hazard posed by the debris on the side of the road. Use caution when approaching the area with traffic cones and tires as they indicate potential hazards. Maintain a lower speed due to wet road conditions and be vigilant for any unexpected movements or obstacles that may be hidden by parked vehicles."

The presence of a warning triangle sign indicates that there may be potential hazards on the road, and you should be ready to stop at any time if necessary. Continual observation of pedestrian dynamics is crucial to anticipating any sudden changes and responding accordingly. Considering vehicles parked on the right, if it is safe, you should merge into the left lane to avoid potential dangers. Due to wet road surfaces, you should also slow down and pay close attention to pedestrians by the roadside. Because of the wet roads, you should increase the following distance from the car in front to compensate. Slow down and prepare to change lanes to the left in order to bypass the parked sedan and the people beside it. Stay alert for any signs of people or other obstacles entering your driving lane and be ready to react at any moment. Observe the traffic behavior of vehicles ahead, as they may be reacting to incidents, such as slowing down or changing lanes, which could influence your decision-making process. Maintain a safe following distance with other vehicles to allow enough reaction time."
