Most commonly, chairs are supported by four legs and have a back; however, they can have a different shape or configuration depending on the design. Chairs are not typical objects found on the road and could indicate a temporary event, such as a roadside rest area, gathering, or a situation where someone has placed it there for an unclear reason. The presence of this chair on the side of the road should not directly influence the behavior of the ego car unless it is obstructing the roadway or is a sign of potential pedestrians nearby, in which case the driver should be extra vigilant to avoid any possible hazards."
