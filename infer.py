# The image is a vibrant and colorful infographic that showcases 7 graphic design trends that will dominate in 2021. The infographic is divided into 7 sections, each representing a different trend.
# Starting from the top, the first section focuses on "Muted Color Palettes", highlighting the use of muted colors in design.
# The second section delves into "Simple Data Visualizations", emphasizing the importance of easy-to-understand data visualizations.
# The third section introduces "Geometric Shapes Everywhere", showcasing the use of geometric shapes in design.
# The fourth section discusses "Flat Icons and Illustrations", explaining how flat icons and illustrations are being used in design.
# The fifth section is dedicated to "Classic Serif Fonts", illustrating the resurgence of classic serif fonts in design.
# The sixth section explores "Social Media Slide Decks", illustrating how slide decks are being used on social media.
# Finally, the seventh section focuses on "Text Heavy Videos", illustrating the trend of using text-heavy videos in design.
# Each section is filled with relevant images and text, providing a comprehensive overview of the 7 graphic design trends that will dominate in 2021.

# The third part of the infographic is about "Geometric Shapes Everywhere". It explains that last year, designers used a lot of
# flowing and abstract shapes in their designs. However, this year, they have been replaced with rigid, hard-edged geometric
# shapes and patterns. The hard edges of a geometric shape create a great contrast against muted colors.
